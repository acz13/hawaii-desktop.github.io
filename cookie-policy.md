**Cookie disclosure statement pursuant to art. 13 of the Italian Privacy Code
drawn up in accordance with the regulation issued by the Italian data
protection authority 08.05.2014**

Informativa originale in italiano [qui](/it/cookie-policy).

# What are cookies?

Cookies are small strings of text that websites visited by a user send to
their terminal, where they are stored and then retransmitted to the same sites
the next time the same user visits that site.

For the purposes here, the cookies are separated into technical and
profiling, depending on the function for which they are used, and into first
party and third party cookies, depending on the subject that installs them.

# Tecnical cookies

"Technical cookies are used for the sole purpose of transmitting a
communication on an electronic communications network or, as strictly
necessary, for sending to the provider of a service of a company the
information explicitly requested by the subscriber or user to deliver
that service" (see art. 122 paragraph 1 of the Italian privacy code).

Cookies can be defined as browsing or session cookies (that guarantee normal
browsing and use of the web site), cookie analytics (assimilated with technical
cookies where they are used directly by the site operator to collect information,
in aggregate form, on the number of users and on how they visit the same site)
and functionality cookies (these allow the user to navigating according to a
set of criteria, such as language, in order to improve the service provided
to the same).

For the installation and use of technical cookies, the prior consent of the
person involved is not required.

# Profiling cookies

Profiling cookies are used to send advertising messages in line with the
preferences expressed by the user in the context of browsing the net.

For use of the profiling cookies, the consent of the person involved
is required.

# Third-party cookies

Taking account of the different subject that installs the cookies on the
user's terminal, depending on whether it involves the same operator of
the site that the user is visiting, or the operator of a different site
that installs the cookies through the first one, a definition is made of
either first-party cookies or third-party cookies.

# Cookies installed from this site

This site only uses technical cookies.

## Measuring our visitors

We measure visitors to our website using Google Analytics.
This records what pages you view within our site, how you arrived at our
site and some basic information about your computer. All of that
information is anonymous - so we donâ€™t know who you are; just
that somebody visited our site.

The information we collect from analytics helps us understand what parts of
our sites are doing well, how people arrive at our site and so on.
Like most websites, we use this information to make our website better.

However we do anonymize IP addresses as explained [here](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2763052?hl=en)
and [here](http://www.iubenda.com/blog/2013/11/13/ip-anonymization-google-analytics-privacy/).

Assimilated to technical cookies in accordance with the regulation issued by the
Italian data protection authority [229 of 08.05.2014](http://www.garanteprivacy.it/web/guest/home/docweb/-/docweb-display/docweb/3118884)
and subsequent FAQ.

You can learn more about [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html)
or [opt out if you wish](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).

### Social networks

News from this web site can be posted to social networks using links to
their sharing tool - those are implemented as normal external
links to avoid tracking how many times the page has been shared.

Social networks therefore could know that you're viewing this website,
if you use their services (that isn't to say they do, but their policies
may change).

Below we provide links to the social networks privacy policies:

* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/privacy?lang=en)
* [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/policy.php)
* [Google+](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/)
* [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/privacypolicy)

As our website is remarkably inoffensive we imagine this is not a
concern for most users.

## Discussion comments

To allow visitors to discuss our web pages we use a discussion
system called Disqus.

To do so we embed code that Disqus provide and we do not control ourselves.
Disqus anonymously tracks visitors to pages like we do.
They also remember who you are if you login to any Disqus service, so you
can comment on any website using their tool.

Logging in to Disqus can be done in many ways, including via Facebook.
If you login via social network, Disqus will be able to link your activity
to that network. In this way, your Disqus activity may be personally
identifiable.

Disqus will know what pages you viewed in our site and what you wrote on
those comments. Of course all comments you leave are also publicly visible on
the Internet alongside your name, so we do not imagine this is a concern for
many people.

You can learn more about [Disqus](http://docs.disqus.com/help/30/) or
[here](https://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/1657951).
