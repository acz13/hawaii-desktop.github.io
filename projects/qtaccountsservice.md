Qt-style API to use freedesktop.org's [AccountsService](http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/AccountsService) DBus service.

AccountsService is a D-Bus service for accessing the list of user accounts
and information attached to those accounts.

AccountsService has been developed in and is used by the GNOME project but
should be usable in other desktops.

This project offers a library that allows Qt applications to use AccountsService
with a Qt-style API from C++ and QML.
