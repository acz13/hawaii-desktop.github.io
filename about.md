# What is Hawaii?

Hawaii is an innovative Linux distribution currently in development that specifically targets personal computing.
Hawaii is a fast, efficient, simple to use, easy to learn and yet powerful system for computer users of all levels.
The desktop environment is lightweight, coherent and fast. It relies on Qt 5, QtQuick and Wayland and is designed to offer the best UX for the device where it is running.
Hawaii doesn't have the traditional packages, it offers an innovative update system with point in time recovery and lower bandwidth usage; applications are shipped as bundles (compressed images that don't need to be decompressed).

# Premises

The Hawaii operating system is 100% free of cost for you to enjoy and share.
It has a custom designed graphical environment designed to be easy to use and engineered to take full advantage of the new technologies that are making Linux so great these days.
