We are proud to announce the immediate availability of SDDM 0.12.0.

This release features working Wayland sessions for the first time,
but the greeter is still running on Xorg.

This means that you will be able to login into a Wayland desktop
environment without problems however the greeter screen still
depends on X11.

Work on the Wayland support for the greeter has already been
started and will likely be available with the next release.

Highlights of this release:

 * BACKWARDS-INCOMPATIBLE: SDDM now depends on Qt >= 5.3
