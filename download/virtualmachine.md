## QEMU

Make sure QEMU and KVM are installed, your host is a x86_64 machine and have at
least 2GB of RAM.

Run the ISO image like this:

```sh
qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm -m 1GB -vga qxl -cdrom hawaii-20151025-x86_64.iso
```

For the more adventurous, here's how to enable networking and forware port 22 from
VM to the host port 10022:

```sh
qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm -m 1GB -vga qxl -net user,hostfwd=tcp::10022-:22 -net nic -cdrom hawaii-20151025-x86_64.iso
```

Please note that SSH is not enabled by default.

## VirtualBox

Unfortunately VirtualBox doesn't support Wayland yet.

## VMware

If you try the ISO image on VMware, please enable 3D acceleration.

To do so select the virtual machine, click on the VM â†’ Settings menu item,
now in the Hardware tab select Display and check Accelerate 3d graphics.
